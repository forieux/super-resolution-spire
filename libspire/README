!!! IMPORTANT !!

All the transfert function must be compute by respecting the zero
convention of the fft2 (when you do Hrond = fft2(H), zero of H must be
in (1,1)). In addition to avoid phase problem, H must be zero padded
and of size Nalpha x Nbeta.

The fft is considered to be normalized.

To help you, and in this actual code, you will found three function :
- ufft2 : a normalized fft to use on all the signal
- ufft2ri : the equivalent to use only on impultionnal response. Si
  the PSF of the instrument but also on regularization operator.
- uifft2 : a inverse normalized ifft2 to use on signal that have been
  filter by the transfert function for example.
