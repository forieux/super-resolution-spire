Super-resolution for SPIRE
==========================

Preamble
--------

This code is no more maintained and not used, up to my knownledge. You
can however contact me for questions (orieux at iap).

Intro

This repository contains the MATLAB code to produce the results of
Super-Resolution of image with SPIRE/Herschel data published in

The research initied during this work have continued to gives the
`SUPREME <http://www.ias.u-psud.fr/supreme/home.php>`_ software
package. I am not, however, involved in this project.
